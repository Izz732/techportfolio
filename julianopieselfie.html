    <div class="text"> <b> Step 1: </b>This is a screenshot of when I finished drawing the outline of my face, mouth and nose. As you can see down the side of the image, I have been using the layers tool for each sperate area of my image. I struggled using the brush tool for the first time because all my lines went crooked. </div>

    <div class="text"> <b> Step 2: </b>This is a screenshot of when I finished doing the outline of my profile picture. I did the outline using the brush tool. I found it quite difficult trying to get my eyes looking normal because I wanted to make them as realistic as possible. I drew the outline of my eyes, body, hair mouth and nose on separate layers so that it would be easier to fix if I made a mistake. I also took the time to fix up any lines that weren’t very good. </div>

    <div class="text"> <b>Step 3: </b>This is a screenshot after I used the paint bucket tool to colour in my face. I found this step the most difficult when doing my Julian Opie selfie because it was a challenge trying to find a realistic skin colour that didn’t make me look like a pumpkin. </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b> Step 4: </b> This is a screenshot of when I was nearly done. At the time, I was also experimenting with different hair colours and I ended up having to change my skin colour because it looked to like my hair. I also began filling in my school uniform and ears. Colouring in my school uniform and ears was a challenge because I couldn’t use the paint bucket tool. I ended up having to colour these by hand. The ears were difficult because they are very small and I had to be careful not to go outside of the lines. </div>
