    <div class="title"> Introduction to Animation </div>
    <div class="text"> 1. Traditional animation:
        Traditional animation is one of the oldest forms of animation. It is where the animator draws every frame individually to create the sequence and then flicks through it very quickly so that it appears as if it is moving.
        2. 2D Vector-based animation:
        This is very similar to traditional animation in the sense that it is hand-draw. However, it is when you use the computer to draw these animations
        3. 3D computer animation:
        3D animation is made by generating images using computers, however, the characters are made 3D online and are digitally modelled. With 3D animation, the animator doesn’t have to redraw every frame individually.
        4. Motion graphics:
        Motion graphics is quite different to other forms of animation. It is not a character or story but is when you move elements or texts for commercial or promotional purposes e.g. animated logos.
        5. Stop motion:
        Stop motion is when you take a photo of an object and then move it a small bit and take another photo. It uses real life materials instead of drawings.

    <div class="text">I used premiere pro to split my video footage into separate images. First, I exported the video so that it split into separate frames.I used the layers tool to make sure that every different aspect of my animation was drawn on a different page. This allowed me to play around with what I wanted to be in the background and with what things would be on top of the other. I used the paint brush tool to draw my animation in color. I then used the paint bucket tool to fill the objects in, so that they were colorful. I faced some setbacks when doing this because if there were any gaps in the outline, it wouldn’t fill in. You find these tools down the side of the page. I also used the eraser tool which is along the side to get rid of any mistakes that I made. My final product is a fully rotoscoped video of a kayak. In order to make my animation original, I added mountains in the background and bubbles coming out of the water. I was originally going to add a dolphin but decided against this because I wanted to keep my animation simple. Whilst making my animation, I did face some setbacks, one of which was my entire animation deleting. I also struggled trying to convert it into an MP4 video. However, overall, I am happy with the end result. </div>
