    <div class="text"> This is my AR marker. I used AR.js marker generator and Brackets to create my marker. This is the first project which we did at the beginning of the year. I didn't face many issues when making it, however it took a bit of experimenting because this was the first time that I had done anything like it. </div>

    <div class="text"> This is a screencast that I took showing how my marker works.  I had trouble trying to insert a screencast showing how my customized AR marker works. This happened because I have never learnt how to put a video into a word document. My solution was to insert the link. </div>
